<h1>404</h1>
<h2>Oops! You Caught Us Off Guard!</h2>
<img alt="team logo" src="/images/logo-img.png">
<p>It looks like you're trying to make a move on a non-existent game board.</p>
<p>Don't worry, we're not mad, we're just disappointed that you've broken the rules of Connect 4 etiquette.</p>
<p>In order to make it up to us, we challenge you to a game of Connect 4!</p>
<p>Take a break from your quest for non-existent pages and let's have some fun.</p>
<button onclick="location.href='http://localhost:80'" style="text-align: center ; width: 15%">Join the right side of
    the board
</button>
<p>And if you're still set on finding that missing page, try looking under the red or yellow discs. Who knows, maybe
    you'll find what you're looking for there.</p>
<p>Good luck, and happy gaming!</p>
